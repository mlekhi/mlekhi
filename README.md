### Hey there, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Maya (she/they), a software developer with a passion for creation.
Currently looking for Summer 2024 SWE internships. Feel free to contact me on my LinkedIn.

Aside from my work as a developer, I'm a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities and resources, regardless of their background. That's why I'm always looking for ways to support and uplift underrepresented communities in tech.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring different creative outlets, such as writing, graphic design, and painting. These hobbies help me stay grounded and keep my mind fresh for tackling new challenges.

I'd love to hear more about you! If you'd like to talk opportunities, or even just want to chat, feel free to connect with me!
